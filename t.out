RANDOM STARTS RESULTS RANKED FROM THE BEST TO THE WORST LOGLIKELIHOOD VALUES

6 perturbed starting value run(s) did not converge in the initial stage
optimizations.

Final stage loglikelihood values at local maxima, seeds, and initial stage start numbers:


Unperturbed starting value run did not converge.

3 perturbed starting value run(s) did not converge.


     THE MODEL ESTIMATION DID NOT TERMINATE NORMALLY DUE TO AN INSUFFICIENT
     NUMBER OF E STEPS.  INCREASE THE NUMBER OF MITERATIONS.  ESTIMATES
