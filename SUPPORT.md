# Getting help with tidyLPA

Thanks for using tidyLPA. Before filing an issue, there are a few places to
explore and pieces to put together to make the process as smooth as possible.

Start by making a minimal **repr**oducible **ex**ample using the [reprex](http://reprex.tidyverse.org/) package. 
If you haven't heard of or used reprex
before, you're in for a treat! Seriously, reprex will make all of your R-
question-asking endeavors easier (which is a pretty insane ROI for the five to
ten minutes it'll take you to learn what it's all about). For additional reprex
pointers, check out the [Get help!](https://www.tidyverse.org/help/) section of
the tidyverse site.

One of the easiest but also most important ways to contribute is to post a
question or to provide feedback. Both positive *and* negative feedback is
welcome and helpful. You can get in touch by . . .

* Sending a message via [tidylpa@googlegroups.com]
(mailto:tidylpa@googlegroups.com) or view the [the tidyLPA group page](https://
groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/tidylpa) (*preferred*)
* Filing an issue on GitHub [here](https://github.com/jrosen48/tidyLPA)

Contributions are also welcome via by making pull requests (PR), e.g. through
[this page on GitHub](https://github.com/jrosen48/tidyLPA/pulls). It may be
easier if you first file an issue outlining what you will do in the PR. You can
also reach out via the methods described above.
