Description: Easily perform mixture modeling for model-based clustering based on the MCLUST package. 
    Provides functionality in terms of how the residual covariance matrix of the clustered variables is
    structured familiar to those who use Latent Profile Analysis. Follows a tidy philosophy, in that 
    output is in the form of a tibble (a data.frame) that can subsequently be computed on.
