Description: An interface to mclust to easily carry out latent profile
analysis (LPA). Provides functionality to estimate commonly-specified models.
Follows a tidy approach, in that output is in the form of a data frame that can
subsequently be computed on. Also has functions to interface to the commericial 
MPlus software via the MplusAutomation package.
