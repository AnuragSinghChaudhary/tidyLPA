Description: An interface to `mclust` to easily carry out latent profile analysis (LPA) Pastor et al. (2007). Provides functionality in terms of how the variable covariance matrix is commonly structured in LPA. Follows a tidy approach, in that output is in the form of a tibble (closely related to a data frame) that can subsequently be computed on.
