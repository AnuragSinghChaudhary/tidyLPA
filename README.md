tidymixmod
==========

The goal of tidymixmod is to interface to the general latent variable model software OpenMx to carry out Latent Profile Analysis (LPA) and Latent Class Analysis.

This is a sister-project to [prcr](https://github.com/jrosen48/prcr), for two-step cluster analysis, and may be merged with it in the future.

Please follow along if interested!
