RANDOM STARTS RESULTS RANKED FROM THE BEST TO THE WORST LOGLIKELIHOOD VALUES


1 perturbed starting value run(s) did not converge.
Final stage loglikelihood values at local maxima, seeds, and initial stage start numbers:


4 perturbed starting value run(s) did not converge.


     THE MODEL ESTIMATION DID NOT TERMINATE NORMALLY DUE TO AN INSUFFICIENT
     NUMBER OF E STEPS.  INCREASE THE NUMBER OF MITERATIONS.  ESTIMATES
