RANDOM STARTS RESULTS RANKED FROM THE BEST TO THE WORST LOGLIKELIHOOD VALUES

54 perturbed starting value run(s) did not converge in the initial stage
optimizations.

Final stage loglikelihood values at local maxima, seeds, and initial stage start numbers:


Unperturbed starting value run did not converge.

99 perturbed starting value run(s) did not converge.


     THE ESTIMATED COVARIANCE MATRIX FOR THE Y VARIABLES IN CLASS 3 COULD NOT
     BE INVERTED.  PROBLEM INVOLVING VARIABLE DM_BEH_E.  COMPUTATION COULD
     NOT BE COMPLETED IN ITERATION 11.  CHANGE YOUR MODEL AND/OR STARTING
     VALUES.  THIS MAY BE DUE TO A ZERO ESTIMATED VARIANCE, THAT IS, NO WITHIN-CLASS
     VARIATION FOR THE VARIABLE.
     THE LOGLIKELIHOOD DECREASED IN THE LAST EM ITERATION.  CHANGE YOUR MODEL
     AND/OR STARTING VALUES.



     THE MODEL ESTIMATION DID NOT TERMINATE NORMALLY DUE TO AN ERROR IN THE
     COMPUTATION.  CHANGE YOUR MODEL AND/OR STARTING VALUES.
